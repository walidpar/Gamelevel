# Black ops 3 Zombies map 


## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

# - "Tower Of Ascension"

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

# - A challange map consisting of a tall tower. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

# - I plan on making a simple tower due to the time and labor restraint. The bottom third of the tower will be "hell" themes, the second third "earth" themes, and lastly "heaven" themed, hence the sanem ascension. I also plan on adding weapons from different call of duty titles, as well as putting in my own sound effects if I can figure that out in time. The map will be a "challenge" map meaning it wll be difficult to beat. Constant waves of enemies, no breaks, many bosses, and unforgiving scenarios. A genre of maps my friends and I specially like playing. I may include a few easter eggs directed towards us, that only we may understand. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

# - Unapplicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

# - Unapplicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

# - A working map with an ending, not too hard nor easy. But well balanced and not glitchy. Walls would just be blank default walls. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

# - Moderatly detailed map fitting the critaeria listed before, walls would be decorated fitting themes of levels. Proper detailing and lighting. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

# - All of which I listed before, plus a few easter eggs, as well as boss-fight before the ending. Possibly "wonder" weapons implemented as well. Meaning weapos with special effects. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

# - I will need to learn map design and detailing using Radiant. I will also need to learn to maniuplate zombie spawn points, player spawn points, as well as figuring out a fair layout of perks/weapons around the map to make it beatable (but not easy). I will then start to make the tower insteelf as well as the stairs and barriers the players must overcome. After making the basis of the entire map, I will then add detailing, figure out proper player spawning, and overall map balancing. I will need to watch the many youtube tutorials I have saved and spend every night workig on it little by little. With possible feedback from friends who are fans of the game as well.
