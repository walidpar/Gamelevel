"# My name is Walid Parast, I am a freshamn in CIS 1051. I decided to make a map for Call of Duty Black ops 3 Zombies. The map is called "Tower of Demise" and is available on steam. I encountered MANY problems making it and spent a lot of time learning how to use "Radiant", which is the map editor software, through many youtube tutorials. I deviated a little from my original theme, which was "hell,earth, and heaven". Instead, its now just "hell", fitting the zombies theme. Other then that, it went as I wanted it to. The challenge level is perfect and gameplay is entertaining and short. The description holds more information.
